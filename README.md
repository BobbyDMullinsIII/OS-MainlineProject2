Project: Project 2 - Client-Server Chat Program

To work on this project, Qt should be installed [here](Qt_install_instructions.md)

In order to have multiple clients communicating with the server on this project, we exported a template of the ChatProgramProject client and created other projects with it in separate Visual Studio 2022 instances to run at once.
